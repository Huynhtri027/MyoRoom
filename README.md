# MyoRoom
Myo Rooms was designed to be the modern leonardo da vinci of household wearables. The range of its uses can span anything from turning on the lights, to opening locked doors, and to turning on in-home entertainment systems.  Myo rooms combines the many features of the Myo band- designed by Thalmic Labs inc., and the Beacon technology- by Estimote to make these features possible. The product connects different appliances to beacons in different locations of the house. When a myo band user is within a certain area covered by a beacon, their gestures are used as inputs and recognized gestures will perform certain tasks such as turning on different lights in a room,   In this early prototype, we created a virtual house in Python and use different gestures and multiple beacons to turn on or off the ceiling light and / or the floor lights in a room at once when the user is within range. The product will be developed further and will be integrated with electro-mechanical parts to provide further features in home and expand the products uses.
